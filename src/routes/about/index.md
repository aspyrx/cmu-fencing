# About Us

The CMU Fencing Club has existed since 2000 and holds practices on Mondays and
Wednesdays in the arena room in Skibo Gym. Fencing is a fun and safe sport, and
it's fantastic for cardiovascular exercise, as there is much emphasis put into
footwork as well as blade movement. Fencers also see improvement in hand-eye
coordination, speed, balance, and reaction time.

We accept students with all levels of fencing experience, with about 25% of our
members having never fenced before, and we provide equipment and coaching for
all three fencing weapons. We typically compete in 3 tournaments every year, as
well as scrimmages with our friends at the University of Pittsburgh.

# Directions

Since the lower entrance is closed indefinitely, you will have to walk further
up Tech St. to the middle entrance to Skibo Gym. Turn left right when you turn
in, and go down the hallway until you see a short hallway to your right, just
before the stairs. Turn in, and go past the vending machines to the end of the
hall and enter the room with the grey floor. Congratulations! You're at
practice.

# Contact

If nobody's at practice, something's come up, or if you have general
questions/concerns, send us an email at
[fencing@andrew.cmu.edu](mailto:fencing@andrew.cmu.edu) and someone will let you
know what's up.
