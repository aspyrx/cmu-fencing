# Welcome to the CMU Fencing Club!

We accept students with all levels of fencing experience, with about 25% of our
members having never fenced before, and we provide equipment and coaching for
all three fencing weapons. [Learn more about us here](./about/).

## Practice Schedule

Fencing practices will be held every Monday and Wednesday from 5:45 to 8:30 in
the Skibo Gym Arena Room ([directions here](./about/#directions)). This includes
3-day weekends (Labor Day, Martin Luther King Day, etc.) but not winter break.

This is subject to change when varsity sports come indoors in the winter and
mess with our times. If something changed, someone has probably sent an email
about it. We'll try to keep this schedule and events on this site up to date as
well.
